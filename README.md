# Twitter Search Engine

## Overview

In this project, I aim to develop an indexer that searches tweets scraped from Twitter efficiently and stores them in a .csv file. Using Snscrape I have scraped tweets based on topics such as social, covid, sports, news, trending, movie, etc. 

Further, I used Lucene and Hadoop respectively to index and search on the basis of the queries entered by users in the UI. The relevant tweets are displayed according to the ranking algorithm on the web interface. 


Project Structure: 
1. Scraping tweets (Crawling) (Part A) 
2. Indexing the crawled data using Lucene and Hadoop. 
3. Searching relevant tweets based on the query from the user. 
4. Display relevant results on the web UI.
